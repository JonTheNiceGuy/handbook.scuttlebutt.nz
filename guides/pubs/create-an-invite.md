# Create an Invite

If you're operating a Pub, you'll need to create invites for new members to join it.

The command to create an invite code is:

```bash
ssb-server invite.create {num-uses}
```

Where `{num-uses}` is the number of times the invite can be used before expiring.
The recommended default is 1.
